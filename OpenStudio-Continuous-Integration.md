## CI Behavior

The CI behavior is unique for each repository, and is defined by each repository's file titled ".gitlab-ci.yml". CI stages which are prone to failures have a "retry" setting which will trigger on any noted failure in that stage.

The GitLab CI repositories each mirror their respective, public-facing GitHub repository. GitHub / GitLab repository is accomplished via polling which occurs every 5 minutes.

## Pull Requests

OpenStudio CI automatically builds and tests OpenStudio pull requests[OpenStudio Application pull requests](OpenStudio-Application-Pull-Requests).
