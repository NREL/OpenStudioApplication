## Forking OpenStudio Application Repository 

#### Using the GUI

Since you have read-only access to the OpenStudio Application repository, you should [create a Fork](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/fork) in order to make changes.  Select your personal account if you are given the option:

Next, download and install [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/), or a Git shell if you
are on a different platform.  Enter your GitHub account username and password, then select your
username in the left column of the GitHub app and clone your fork:

<!--
    TODO: Image needs to be updated.
-->

Now that you have a clone of your fork, create a branch for your feature development:

<!--
    TODO: Image needs to be updated.
-->

Once you have committed and pushed all of your changes, and your branch is ready to be approved for
inclusion in the main OpenStudio Application repository, click the green Compare button in your fork on
github.com and follow [GitHub's
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for submitting a pull
request.

#### Using CLI

To fork, copy the clone URL and replace _NREL_ with your GitHub username. When your changes are ready to be approved for inclusion in the main OpenStudio Application
repository, click the [[/images/Using-OpenStudio-with-Git-and-GitHub/compare.png]] Compare button in
your fork and follow [GitHub's
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for submitting a pull
request.
