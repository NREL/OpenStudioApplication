OpenStudio Geometry Editor is an experimental feature, it is not yet reccomended for production use.<br><br>

At this stage we are encouraging user to try out the tool and provide feedback to <a href="mailto:openstudio@nrel.gov?Subject=Geometry%20Editor%20Feedback" target="_top">openstudio@nrel.gov</a>.<br><br>

Currently, the OpenStudio Geometry Editor cannot be used on OpenStudio Models with existing geometry developed outside of the Geometry Editor.<br><br>

The suggested workflow is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new OpenStudio Model.</li>
  <li>Import Space Types, Default Construction Sets, Thermal Zones, and other resources in the OpenStudio Application.</li>
  <li>Create a new floorplan in the Geometry Editor.</li>
  <li>Work through the model creating Spaces on each Story.  Define the geometry for each Space by selecting the Space and using either the Rectangle or Polygon tool to draw.  Note that each Space must have a single floor surface and Spaces on the same story cannot overlap.</li>
  <li>Assign Space Type, Default Construction Set, Thermal Zone and other properties to each Space and Story.  You can create new Space Types, Default Construction Sets, Thermal Zones, and other resources using the library in the bottom pane.</li>
  <li>Use the preview buttom to preview your geometry in 3D.</li>
  <li>When you are satisfied with your geometry, use the merge button to apply your floorplan geometry to the current OpenStudio Model.  Changes made to the floorplan in the Geometry Editor will not affect your current OpenStudio Model until you perform the merge step.</li>
  <li>Continue editing your OpenStudio Model in the OpenStudio Application; switching back to edit the floorplan using the Geometry Editor as needed.  Each time you make a change to the floorplan you will need to re-merge with the current OpenStudio Model.</li>
</ol>

Current known issues are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Placement of windows, daylighting controls, and other components is not yet available.  These objects can be added via measures available on the BCL.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for giving the OpenStudio Geometry Editor a try, please let us know what you think!<br><br>
