<a href="https://github.com/NREL/floorspace.js">FloorspaceJS</a> is a new, open source software module that developers can leverage to produce building energy modeling UIs which include geometry creation.  FloorspaceJS is meant to cover simple building geometry use cases only.  More complex building geometry is best developed in a full featured CAD tool and exported to gbXML or other formats for building energy modeling.  FloorspaceJS is implemented in JavaScript with minimal dependencies, allowing it to be integrated into a wide range of applications, including the OpenStudio Application.<br><br>

FloorspaceJS and its integration within the OpenStudio Application are experimental.  We invite users to try these software components out and provide feedback at <a href="mailto:openstudio@nrel.gov?Subject=FloorspaceJS%20Feedback" target="_top">openstudio@nrel.gov</a> to help us make it better for use by third party developers.  Instructions for using the FloorspaceJS within the OpenStudio Application are available at <a href="https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/geometry_editor/">openstudio.net</a>.<br><br>

Currently, the integrated FloorsplaceJS widget cannot be used on OpenStudio Models with existing geometry developed outside of FloorspaceJS.<br><br>

The suggested workflow is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new OpenStudio Model.</li>
  <li>Import Space Types, Default Construction Sets, Thermal Zones, and other resources in the OpenStudio Application.</li>
  <li>Create a new floorplan using FloorspaceJS.</li>
  <li>Work through the floorplan creating Spaces on each Story.  Define the geometry for each Space by selecting the Space and using either the Rectangle or Polygon tool to draw.  Note that each Space must have a single floor surface and Spaces on the same story cannot overlap.</li>
  <li>Assign Space Type, Default Construction Set, Thermal Zone and other properties to each Space and each Story.  You can create new Space Types, Default Construction Sets, Thermal Zones, and other resources in the FloorspaceJS navigator.</li>
  <li>Use the preview buttom to preview your geometry in 3D.</li>
  <li>When you are satisfied with your geometry, use the merge button to apply your floorplan geometry to the current OpenStudio Model.  Changes made to the floorplan in FloorspaceJS will not affect your current OpenStudio Model until you perform the merge step.</li>
  <li>Continue editing your OpenStudio Model in the OpenStudio Application; switching back to edit the floorplan using FloorspaceJS as needed.  Each time you make a change to the floorplan you will need to re-merge with the current OpenStudio Model.</li>
</ol>
